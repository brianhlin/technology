OSG/HTCondor CREAM-CE Support
==============================


The CREAM working group has [recently announced](#reference) official support for the
CREAM-CE will cease in December 2020.  With this email, we are soliciting
feedback on OSG and HTCondorâ€™s transition plan.  OSG and HTCondor remain committed
to supporting VOs who need to access to CREAM-CE based resources throughout the
transition period; we will continue to support submission to CREAM-CE endpoints
and offer assistance to VOs to manage the transition.

OSG runs a glidein submission service that submits to grid infrastructures worldwide
on behalf of dozens of science projects.  This service currently submits to
approximately 100 CREAM-CE endpoints; we will continue to maintain the capability
to access these endpoints while we assist sites in testing and enabling ARC-CE
and/or HTCondor-CE replacement services.

The HTCondor team plans to support the CREAM-CE on EL6/7 in the 8.8.x stable release
series and will maintain support for 8.8.x through December 2020.  CREAM-CE support
will remain enabled at the start of the 8.9.x developer series; in early 2020, the
HTCondor team will re-evaluate, based on community need, whether CREAM-CE support
will be available in the next stable series.

We realize that software retirements can be very disruptive; the OSG and HTCondor
teams are committed to assisting user communities through the process.  If you
believe our plan does not fit the needs of your user community, please contact
<help@osg-htc.org>.

Brian Bockelman, OSG Technology Area Coordinator

Todd Tannenbaum, HTCondor Technical Lead
