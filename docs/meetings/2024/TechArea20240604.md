### Support Update

-  JLab (Mat): user having strange permission issue with Vault support; Mat asking Jason from the HTCondor dev team for help
-  SDSC (Mat): user having trouble with the OSDF director and resorting to pulling from caches directly.
    The issue seems to be with the origin; Mat will ask Fabio, who runs that origin, about its status
-  JLab (Matt): their xrootd-multiuser issue is caused by xrootd-multiuser refusing to switch to a group with a
    GID less than 500 (probably for security reasons); Derek is discussing solutions with the admin
