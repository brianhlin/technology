## OSG Software Team

Release:
-   AI (Mat): Cut a new release of osg-token-renewer
-   AI (BrianL): Update OSG 3.6 and 23 release notes with upcoming EOL warnings

### Discussion

-   TimT: HTCondor 23.5 being deployed on CHTC today for testing; release planned for early March;
    will coordinate with Pelican team to include Pelican 7.6 in the release
-   BrianB spotted SHA1 code in HTCondor, which should not work in EL9,
    but does not appear to cause problems in practice

-   There was some discussion regarding aligning HTCondor-CE releases with HTCondor releases but more investigation
    needs to be done in order to come up with a solution that meets everybody's needs without much increase
    in workload
