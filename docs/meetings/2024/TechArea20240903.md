    - Continuing OSG 24 setup

-   AI (TimT): verify that release scripts can handle multiple architectures;

### Discussion

-   "opensciencegrid" project on Harbor has almost filled its quota;
    tag immutability rules and a critical bug in Harbor garbage collection make it difficult to clean up
    -   A student may be starting later this month, to be supervised by Matt;
        writing scripts to assist Harbor image cleanup by using its API would be a good project for her

### Support Update

-   LBL / ORNL (BrianL): assissting them set up their HTCondor-CE for ALICE
-   JLAB (Matt): credmon started working when run as root without their wrapper script
-   LIGO (Matt): stash-cache service now fails to start after SystemD overrides;
    the actual error is coming from the authfile-update script
-   OU (Mat): new xrootd-standalone setup failed to start xrootd due to 'CA errors';
    the actual issue was that XRootD was configured to require CRLs and they were missing
