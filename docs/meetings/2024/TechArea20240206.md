## OSG Software Team

Doc focus afternoon of Feb 9

Kubernetes Hackathon:
-   AI (BrianL): move OSPool EP gratia probe to OSG 23
-   AI (Mat): assist William with 7.5.0 upgrades, review OSDF Pelican cache and origin bases.
    Keep an eye toward splitting out a non-OSDF Pelican cache/origin base.
-   AI (Matt): Kick off xDD mongodb migration to k8s

Release:
-   AI (Mat): troubleshoot OSDF cache tests blocking XRootD and xrdcl-pelican releases
-   AI (Matt): Cut a new release of osg-token-renewer
-   AI (Matt): Release XRootD 5.6.7
    -   Carry over BrianB's patches from 5.6.6

### Discussion

None this week

### Support Update

-   Hosted CEs (BrianL, Mat): ran into issues with `%ghost` dirs in osg-configure not being created in the version of
    RPM available on EL9 (and maybe EL8?)
    -   Fix: Explicitly add ghost directories to file list
    -   Issue may occur in other packages as well
-   Emails (BrianL): Google and other email providers are starting to get stricter about SPF records meeting RFC
    requirements.
    We are getting bitten by the 10 DNS lookups in the SPF record max.
    Freshdesk alone uses 10.
-   XRootD (Matt W): New upstream might fix long-running JLab issue
## DevOps

-   Derek: Profiling performance of XRootD monitoring shoveler, DNS lookups and logging found to be a choke-point
-   Derek/BrianL: Configure a new Traefik instance
-   GRACC conversion to Tiger OpenSearch is ongoing.
-   Derek did some profiling and optimization of xrootd collector: https://derekweitzel.com/2024/01/31/profiling-xrootd-collector/

## OSG Release Team

-   Ready for Testing
    -   osg-configure, frontier-squid, voms, vault
    -   frontier-squid is high priority, contains a number of CVEs
-   Ready for Release
    -   Nothing yet
-   Outstanding question: how to announce Pelican releases
-   Discussion topic: Running OSG tests prior to promoting daily condor releases
    - The current config supports this, osg-development already pulls from condor daily repos
