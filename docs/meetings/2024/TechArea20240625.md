## OSG Software Team

Kubernetes Hackathon
-  Remaining repo work
-  Convert prod services in the osg namespace to EL9
-  Check if there are any EL7 containers on Tempest
-  Turn off osgdev services on EL7

### Discussion

-   The "contact-repo" app is on OSG 3.6; if it needs updating, contact Nebraska folks about it.

-   "lightweight-issuer" is in the osgdev namespace but being used in production;
    it needs to be upgraded to EL9 and moved to the osg namespace.  Derek will investigate.

-   GlideinWMS 3.10.7 has been released and built into osg-development

### Support Update

-   BrianL: PATh Facility at UNL went down to expired Kubernetes certs.
    Our CoreDNS app uses an image that is no longer available.

-   BrianL: Assisting Huijun at UNL with HTCondor 23 upgrade; condor_status was failing
    due to the default security settings but a workaround was available.

-   Derek: Ticket regarding xrootd assistance was assigned to Operations but should
    be rerouted to Collaboration Support.
