Marco:
-   Release candidate 3.10.6 expected soon:
    -   CMS has asked for additional factory attributes
    -   Bugfix for match policy
    -   Added compatibility for new versions of m2crypto

    -   The feature for sending arbitrary tokens along with the Glideins (for example for testing authenticated access
        in the pilot startup scripts) is in the devel (3.11) series.

-   HTCondor code freezes will be on Tuesday instead of Friday to give CHTC additional time for testing
    new release candidates before deploying them on OSPool.
