## OSG Software Team

-   AI (Mat):
    -   Deploy OSPool environment changes from "main-canary" to "main" and "main-gpu"
    -   Deploy OSPool prepare-job-hook into "main-canary"
    -   Add extra debugging to XRootD
-   AI (Carl):
    -   EL9 support next items:
        -   EL9 VMU images (debug VMs with vnc).
        -   EL9 spreadsheet link is in SOFTWARE-5416;
            divide and conquer with Mat over the next few weeks.
        -   Note no HTCondor 10.0 or dependent pkgs for el9 release;
            need to wait for 10.2.0 in upcoming.
        -   A few pkgs will have version differences.
-   AI: add resource-based OSDF lookups to Topology and the xcache container
-   AI (BrianL): NVidia GPU osgvo-docker-pilot

### Discussion

- Topology contact registrations are now self-service in comanage.

-   Mat/Carl: next couple weeks:
    -   Take a look at plates; backlog of tasks that you'd like to do
        but haven't had time to do.
    -   Fine as long as we're making progress on el9 and ospool.
    -   If there's no ticket make one.
    -   BrianL may add some wishlist items.

### Support Update

-   University of Arkansas Little Rock (BrianL): help them register an ORCID account for use with the OS Registry
-   CMS SW (BrianB, BrianL, Mat, TimT): assist them with OSG 3.5 software dependency issue
-   Carl UConn CC\* gratia issue Richard T. Jones; resolved
-   There's an XRootD 5.5 issue; see https://osg-htc.org/docs/release/osg-36/#xrootd
