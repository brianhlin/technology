## OSG Software Team

-   Kubernetes hackathon
    -   AI (Brian): upgrade Prometheus
    -   AI (Mat): EL9 repo?
    -   AI (Mat): GLBRC origins
    -   AI (Mat): one of sealed-secrets or cert-manager upgrades
    -   AI (Matt): IGWN CVMFS on the PATh Facility
    -   AI (Matt): PATh FIU IPv6

-   OSG 24:
    -   Package builds assigned!
    -   AI (Matt): ARM OSPool EP containers?
        -   Need to debug x86_64 Singularity test failures causes by adding arm
        -   Add CPU/memory limiting
        -   Custom GitHub action for building Docker images needs to be fixed for multiarch builds;
    -   AI (Matt): Merge Mat's repo-scripts PRs for updating the repo server;
        need to put osg-release for OSG 24 on repo to start testing

### Discussion

-   OSPool ARM Singularity images (for payload jobs) do not exist -- Mat, Mats need to design a scheme
    for distinguishing them from x86_64

-   Kuantifier (Matt): Suggested Prometheus metrics for Kuantifier are easy to access,
    but the required config changes are not well documented which suggests a low usage rate across the community.
    The current Kuantifier user base is well versed in Kubernetes so this should be fine for now.

### Support Update

-   Many support requests are coming in from IGWN because they want to use the PATh Facility
-   Mat (ComputeCanada-Cedar for IGWN): Singularity support wasn't being enabled because GlideinWMS
    startup scripts were requiring the default images to be from CVMFS.  Fixed in frontend config.
