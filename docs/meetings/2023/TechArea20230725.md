## OSG Software Team


Kubernetes Hackathon

-   AI (Mat): Upgrade PATh Facility central manager
-   AI (Mat): Investigate PATh Facility autoscaler issues
-   AI (Matt): Perform various cleanup tasks on the OSG Repo server Kubernetes configuration


OSG 23:

-   AI (Matt): Update OSG Repo scripts to work with OSG 23 naming scheme
-   AI (Matt, with Mat): Build "buildsys-macros" packages for OSG 23

### Discussion

-   Planning to have the copy of the OSDF plugin that is shipped with HTCondor come from the Pelican repo instead of osdf-client;
   this can be done independently of HTCondor 23
-   TimT: HTCondor 10.0.7 will be released today, and will have the newest version of scitokens-cpp in the tarballs.
    HTCondor 10.7.0 will be released later this week and will have apptainer in the tarballs.
   

### Support Update

-   TimT: Bockjoo at UFlorida requests packaging "xrootd-cmstfc" for EL9;
    this is a "contrib" package meaning it's not officially supported by OSG Software.
    If building for EL9 is easy then we can do it ourselves, otherwise we will have to contact the developer.
-   Matt: Created IGTF certs for UColorado and send them to the admin;
    Matt should ping them admin since they haven't responded
-   Topology/GGUS (BrianL, Mat): GÃ¼nter is trying to get a new certificate working with Topology but running into SSL issues.
    SHA1 was a red herring: SHA1 support was disabled in EL9, not EL8, and Topology is still EL8.
    Mat will debug.
