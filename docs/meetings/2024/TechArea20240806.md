### Discussion

None this week

### Support Update

-  University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (BrianL): NVIDIA MPS server (provides a CUDA interface) seems to be causing
   glideins to hang upon `condor_gpu_discovery`. NVIDIA recommends against using MPS across multiple jobs (but may be
   useful for a single user).
   - Add check to see if it's enabled? Show up as a process under `ps`
       - Probably not exposed to containers
- JLab (Mat): Support in setting up Pelican Origin, setting up weekly meeting
