## OSG Software Team

OSG 23:

-   AI (Matt, with Mat): Build "buildsys-macros" packages for OSG 23. Done?
-   AI (Matt): Convert mash scripts to Pungi (SOFTWARE-5621)
    -   We decided that merging the UW HTCondor and OSG repos would require hackery and also moving to Pungi is too
        large a lift so we will do the remaining work with mash
-   AI (Mat): update osg-promote to allow Yubikey package signing. Is there a ticket?
    -   Mat to create a ticket
-   AI (BrianL): build OSG 23 package list

### Support Update

-   CRIC (Mat): X.509 certificate Topology access turned out to be a user issue (missing client certificate bit)
