### Discussion

GlideinWMS:
-   3.10.3 release candidate in progress
-   CMS ran into a bug with 3.9.6 where the factory wasn't updating the number of glideins
    and kept sending new glideins.
    This had been fixed in 3.10; if you are using tokens, be sure to use GlideinWMS 3.10 or newer.

Brief overview of OSG 3.7 plans so far:
-   OSG 3.7 layout will not differ much from previous layouts (i.e. will have "main" and "upcoming")
-   OSG release schedules starting with 3.7 will be aligned with HTCondor release schedules (starting with 11):
    3.7-main will have HTCondor 11.0, and 3.7-upcoming will have HTCondor 11.x
-   OSG team is experimenting with new signing procedures; this should not impact developers
