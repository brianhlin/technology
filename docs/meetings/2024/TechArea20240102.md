## OSG Software Team

-   Brian B was unable to reproduce the failures that the `osg-ca-certs` package change is meant to work around
    (and so unable to verify that the workaround worked).
    We will need to ask the original reporter to reproduce it

-   AI (Mat): add Institution to OSG ID mapping Topology endpoint
-   AI (Mat): release `xrdcl-pelican`
-   AI (Matt): replace the deprecated `save-state` and `set-output` commands in GitHub Actions with Environment files

<!-- from last time
Miscellaneous:

-   AI (Matt): build OSDF cache helm chart

Remaining OSG 23 items <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-5503>.
-   AI (Matt): Figure out if we need VOMS for EL9/an update to EL8
-   AI (BrianL): Finish transition of internal containers to OSG 23
-   AI (Mat): Investigate automatically regenerating development/minefield repos
