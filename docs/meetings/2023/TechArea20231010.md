## OSG Software Team

A fair amount of OSG 23 work remains <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-5503>,
though some tickets look like they may be able to be closed.
Top priorities include:
-   Fix build signing/development (fixed by Matt)
-   Test and provide instructions for FNAL build access
-   Figure out if we need VOMS for EL9/an update to EL8
-   Update docs for OSG 23 tarballs and images

Miscellaneous
-   AI (BrianL, Mat, Matt): offboard Carl and Brian Chase
