## OSG Software Team

OSG 23:

-   AI (Matt): Update mash scripts to merge OSG and UW HTCondor repos (SOFTWARE-5653)
    - Table in design doc for which htcss repos to merge with osg
-   AI (Matt): Complete the two -contrib builds (reach out to Mat for what to do with repo) 
-   AI (Matt): Kick off OSG 23 XRootD tests (worker node and XRootD)
    - Most tests require the OSG-23 condor build, these two don't
    - May require slight updates to test repo
-   AI (BrianL): review OSG 23 package builds
    - Rebuild osg-release with new signing keys
-   AI (TimT): populate HTCSS 23 daily repo
    - Outstanding: condor, condor-plugin. Should be complete today (08/29)
    - Issue: Things are still signed with Condor 10.X keys. Will need to get the signing keys to Tim somehow
    - Will need to create a separate yubikey for this
    - Issue: Moria is EL7, where we've previously seen issues in signing
    - Could also sign on an EL8 machine in the current workflow, maybe
-   AI (Matt): Create new signing yubikey to address the above issue
-   AI (Mat): osg-promote updates
    - Next step is koji
-   AI (Mat): Figure out issues with PATh-Wisc deployment

OSG 3.6

-   AI (Matt): follow-up with Josh Willis regarding XRootD build available in testing

Miscellaneous

-   AI (BrianL): sort out osg-bot 2FA
    - Should largely work as-is for automated actions with access tokens
    - 2FA changes will cause issues if we need to log into the account though

### Discussion

None this week

### Support Update

-   COManage (BrianL): work with CILogon to identify group misconfiguration issues;
    helped Will Leight with linking org IDs (contact CILogon about strange error)
    - Issue: Group IDs and user IDs are becoming misaligned, which breaks COManage provisioning assumptions
    - Issue: Users with multiple identities cannot be successfully linked to a single COManage user entity
