## OSG Software Team

Kubernetes Hackathon ideas:
-   Add CVMFS port redirection to cache base
-   Add multi-export support to Pelican origins
-   Remove `topology-scitokens-fetcher` from base cache and origin bases
-   Add osg-htc.org CNAMEs to production Yum repos
-   Add nodeSelector to the k8s gratia probe

BrianL and Jason will be late to the hackathon due to a regularly conflicting Fellows meeting

This week, let's focus on tackling our support tickets:
-   GGUS ticket about HP4CL where they're asking about `Active: False` resources
-   Many tickets in overdue yesterday, lots of tickets in "Customer responded" state: 

### Discussion

None this week

### Support Update

-  SWT2 (BrianL): had some back and forth with Armen around installing the k8s gratia probe.
   Passed along feedback to Ryan and Matt around config, started registering the resource in Topology.
   Should we create a separate service or is `Execution Endpoint` sufficient?
   BrianL leans towards the latter.
