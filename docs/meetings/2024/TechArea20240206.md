## OSG Software Team

Doc focus afternoon of Feb 9

Kubernetes Hackathon:
-   AI (BrianL): move OSPool EP gratia probe to OSG 23
-   AI (Mat): assist William with 7.4.0 upgrades, review OSDF Pelican cache and origin bases.
    Keep an eye toward splitting out a non-OSDF Pelican cache/origin base.

Release:
-   AI (Mat): troubleshoot OSDF cache tests blocking XRootD and xrdcl-pelican releases
-   AI (Matt): Cut a new release of osg-token-renewer

OSG Yum repo:
-   AI (Matt): Remove HTCondor RC syncing to upcoming-testing.
    Maybe we should do the same for testing and have the dev team create an updates repo for the LTS series?
-   AI (Matt): serve 23-internal from repo

### Discussion

None this week

### Support Update

-   Hosted CEs (BrianL, Mat): ran into issues with `%ghost` dirs in osg-configure not being created in the version of
    RPM available on EL9 (and maybe EL8?)
-   Emails (BrianL): Google and other email providers are starting to get stricter about SPF records meeting RFC
    requirements.
    We are getting bitten by the 10 DNS lookups in the SPF record max.
    Freshdesk alone uses 10.
