## OSG Software Team

Kubernetes hackathon
-  Potential 1.27 upgrade tasks
-  Matt: Enable shoveler on PATh Facility origin

Release:
-   Frontier Squid status?
-   AI (Mat): Release XRootD 5.6.5+
-   AI (Mat): release `xrdcl-pelican`
-   AI (Matt): Update oidc-agent to 5.1.0+; test against the token renewer

OSG repo tasks:
-   Remove HTCondor RC syncing to upcoming-testing.
    Maybe we should do the same for testing and have the dev team create an updates repo for the LTS series?
-   Add the ability to remove HTCondor RPMs

### Discussion

- Tim T:
    - HTCondor 23.3.1 will be released with Pelican 7.4.0
    - HTCondor 23.4.0 in progress; recent builds fixed the central manager memory leak issue

- Marco:
    - GlideinWMS will be built in OSG development today

### Support Update

-   Kagra origin (Mat): Authfiles weren't getting local changes because they had an outdated mirror of the OSG repos
    and therefore and old version of the authfile updater

## DevOps

None this week

## OSG Release Team

-   Ready for Testing
    -   vault, htvault-config
        - both low priority packages
-   Ready for Release
