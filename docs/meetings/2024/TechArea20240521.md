## OSG Software Team

Release:
-   XRootD fixes for Pelican

Yum Repo (Mat):
-   Next step: Write pungi config for koji integration

Kubernetes Gratia Probe (Matt):
-   Let's get this ready in some installable form for SWT2 this week
  
### Discussion

-   Code freeze for HTCondor 23.8 is this week; TimT to discuss tarball update policy with factory ops team.
    A new version of Pelican is not necessary since there have been no client/plugin changes released since Pelican 7.8.2

-   HTCondor-CE 23.8 will be put into osg-23-upcoming soon; this version disables support for legacy job route syntax, which is a breaking change.
    AI (TimT): Send a heads up with information about this, as well as how to use the provided migration script

-   GlideinWMS 3.10.7rc1 is being tested; no problems seen yet, so the final release is expected shortly.

### Support Update

-  University of Chicago (BrianL): AP22 origin did not work due to mismatched signing key on disk vs HTCondor
   configuration. Nothing in XRootD origin logs, look key IDs
-  Topology (BrianL): Unknown projects in CE dashboard. Combination of unregistered projects in Topology (hence needing
   a quick turnaround time on them), misconfigured APs, and missing `ProjectName` attribute in Glideins
