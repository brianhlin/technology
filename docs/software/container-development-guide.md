Container Development Guide
===========================

This document contains instructions for OSG Technology Team members, including:

- How to to develop container images that adhere to our [container release policy](/policy/container-release)
- How to build a new version of an existing image
- How to manage tags for images in the [OSG DockerHub organization](https://hub.docker.com/r/opensciencegrid/)
- Tips for container image development


New Containers Using GitHub Actions (preferred)
-----------------------------------------------

### Creating a new container image ###

#### Prepare the GitHub repository ####

1. Create a Git repository in the `opensciencegrid` organization whose name is prefixed with `docker-`,
   e.g. `docker-frontier-squid`
1. Create a `README.md` file describing the software provided by the image
1. Create a `LICENSE` file containing the [Apache 2.0 license text](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt)
1. Create a `Dockerfile` based off of the OSG Software Base image:

        FROM opensciencegrid/software-base:fresh

        LABEL maintainer OSG Software <support@opensciencegrid.org>

        RUN yum update -y && \
            yum clean all && \
            rm -rf /var/cache/yum/*

        RUN yum install -y <PACKAGE> --enablerepo=osg-minefield && \
            yum clean all && \
            rm -rf /var/cache/yum/*


    Replacing `<PACKAGE>` with the name of the RPM you'd like to provide in this container image

1. Copy over `.github/workflows/build-container.yml` from a previous docker build GitHub repo
   (e.g., <https://github.com/opensciencegrid/docker-frontier-squid>) to the same path in your new git repo.
1. Update the `if: github.repository` line in the new copy of `build-container.yml` to match the new git repo name.
   (This should keep the `opensciencegrid/` org prefix, and the new git repo name should start with `docker-`.)
1. Also update the `repository:` line (in `build-container.yml`) under `uses: docker/build-push-action@v1` to match the
   corresponding DockerHub repo name.
   (This also should keep the `opensciencegrid/` org prefix, and the repo name is generally the same as the git repo,
   except without the `docker-` prefix.)
1. If there are any other references to the old repo name (e.g., `checkout frontier-squid`),
   replace these with the new repo name.
1. Give write permissions to the "osg-bot" user for this GitHub repo, navigating to:
   1. "Settings"
   1. "Manage access"
   1. "Invite teams or people"
   1. Search for and select "osg-bot"
   1. Choose the "Write" role, and click the button to Add osg-bot to the repo.
   (The osg-bot user needs this permission in order to trigger automatic builds.)
1. Ask the Software Manager to set up `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` secrets for this new repo.

#### Prepare the Docker Hub repository ####

1. Create a Docker Hub repo in the OSG organization.
   The name should generally match the GitHub repo name, without the `docker-` prefix.
1. Go to the permissions tab and give the `robots` and `technology` teams `Read & Write` access

#### Set up repository dispatch from docker-software-base ####

1. Edit the
   [GitHub Actions workflow for docker-software-base](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/docker-software-base/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-container.yml),
   and add the new GitHub repo name to the `dispatch-repo:` list (under `jobs:` `dispatch:` `strategy:` `matrix:`).
1. Make a Pull Request for your change.

#### Triggering Container Image Builds ####

To build a new version of an [existing container image](#creating-a-new-container-image-github-actions),
e.g. for a new RPM version of software in the container, you can kick off a new build in one of two ways:

- **If there are no changes necessary to the container packaging:** go to the GitHub repository's latest build under
  Actions, e.g. <https://github.com/opensciencegrid/docker-frontier-squid/actions/>, and click "Re-run jobs" ->
  "Re-run all jobs".
- **If changes need to be made to the container packaging:** submit a pull request with your changes to the relevant
  GitHub repository and request that another team member review it.
  Once merged into `master`, a GitHub Actions build should start automatically.

If the GitHub Actions build completes successfully, you should shortly see new `fresh` and timestamp tags appear in the
DockerHub repository.

!!! info "Automatic weekly rebuilds"
    If the repo's GitHub Actions are configured as above, container images will automatically rebuild,
    and therefore pick up new packages available in minefield once per week.

New Containers Using Travis CI
-----------------------------------

### Creating a New Container Image ###

#### Prepare the GitHub repository ####

1. Create a Git repository in the `opensciencegrid` organization whose name is prefixed with `docker-`,
   e.g. `docker-frontier-squid`
1. Create a `README.md` file describing the software provided by the image
1. Create a `LICENSE` file containing the [Apache 2.0 license text](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt)
1. Create a `Dockerfile` based off of the OSG Software Base image:

        FROM opensciencegrid/software-base:fresh

        LABEL maintainer OSG Software <support@opensciencegrid.org>

        RUN yum update -y && \
            yum clean all && \
            rm -rf /var/cache/yum/*

        RUN yum install -y <PACKAGE> --enablerepo=osg-minefield && \
            yum clean all && \
            rm -rf /var/cache/yum/*


    Replacing `<PACKAGE>` with the name of the RPM you'd like to provide in this container image

#### Prepare the DockerHub repository ####

1. Create a Docker Hub repo in the OSG organization.
1. Go to the permissions tab and give the `robots` and `technology` teams `Read & Write` access
1. Copy over `.travis.yml` and `travis/` from a previous docker build (e.g., <https://github.com/opensciencegrid/docker-frontier-squid>).
   Update the `docker_repos` in `build_docker.sh` to the name of the Docker Hub repo
1. Set the `+x` bit on `travis/build_docker.sh`
1. Send the `opensciencegrid` GitHub repository URL to the Software Manager and ask them to do the following:
    1. Enable the repository in Travis-CI
    1. Add the OSG Software Docker Hub account credentials to the Travis CI repository as secure variables
       `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` only available to the `master` branch.
       Ensure that `Display value in build log` remains unset.
       Escape any special characters with `\`.
    1. Enable weekly cron builds from `master` and set `Always run`

#### Triggering Container Image Builds ####

To build a new version of an [existing container image](#creating-a-new-container-image), e.g. for a new RPM version of
software in the container, you can kick off a new build in one of two ways:

- **If there are no changes necessary to the container packaging:** go to the repository's latest Travis-CI build off of
  `master`, e.g. <https://travis-ci.org/opensciencegrid/docker-xcache>, and click "Restart build"
- **If changes need to be made to the container packaging:** submit a pull request with your changes to the relevant
  GitHub repository and request that another team member review it.
  Once merged into `master`, a Travis-CI build should start automatically.

If the Travis-CI build completes successfully, you should shortly see new `fresh` and timestamp tags appear in the
DockerHub repository.

!!! info "Automatic weekly rebuilds"
    If the repo's Travis-CI is configured as above, container images will automatically rebuild, and therefore pick up
    new packages available in minefield once per week.

Managing Tags in DockerHub
--------------------------

### Adding tags ###

Images that have passed acceptance testing should be tagged as `stable`:

1. Install the `jq` utility:

        yum install jq

1. Get the sha256 repo digest of the image that the user has tested.
   All you need is the part that starts with `sha256:...` (aka the `<DIGEST>`).

1. (Optional) If you are tagging multiple images, you can enter your Docker Hub username and password into environment
   variables, to avoid having to re-type them.
   Otherwise the script will prompt for them.

        read user     # enter dockerhub username
        read -s pass  # enter dockerhub password
        export user pass

1. Run the Docker container image tagging command from [release-tools](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/release-tools/):

        ./dockerhub-tag-fresh-to-stable.sh <IMAGE NAME> <DIGEST>

### Removing tags ###

Run the Docker container image pruning command from [release-tools](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/release-tools/):

    ./dockerhub-prune-tags.py <IMAGE NAME>
