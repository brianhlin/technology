### Support Update

-  AGLT2 (BrianL): unpriv users could not query CM from AP.
   Dev team suggested that they add ANONYMOUS to `SEC_READ_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS` on the CM and
   `SEC_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS` on the AP.
-  FNAL (BrianL): `voms-server` systemd regression -- need to work with them to transition to IAM or similar solution
    - Would prefer dropping `voms-server` from osg-24 software stack, rely on epel
    - Project is not sufficiently supported upstream
    - Need to figure out what to do with OSG patches
