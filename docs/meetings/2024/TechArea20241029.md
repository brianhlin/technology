OSG 24: aiming for release this Thursday!

-   VMU tests look pretty bad with testing + release as expected. Do we have a run against development?
-   Pelican 7.11.0 won't be ready by the initial release so we'll release with 7.10.11 and tell folks to hold off on
    installation / upgrade
-   Need to make a decision on `hosted-ce-tools` when Mat gets back
-   AI (BrianL): write up OSG 24 initial release, review Matt's OSG 24 changes, OSDF origin/cache 
-   Container images:
    -   AI (Matt): Fix `ospool-ep` GHA + upgrade instructions
    -   Following repos need OSG 24 added:
