## OSG Software Team

Doc focus today! Tickets incoming

Release
-   AI (Mat): release `xrdcl-pelican`
-   AI (Matt): verify cadist is populated by `osg-ca-certs-java`

Miscellaneous:
-   AI (BrianL, Mat): deploy ITB OSDF Pelican origin
-   AI (Matt): build OSDF cache helm chart

Remaining OSG 23 items <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-5503>.
-   AI (Matt): Figure out if we need VOMS for EL9/an update to EL8
-   AI (BrianL): Finish transition of internal containers to OSG 23
-   AI (Mat): Investigate automatically regenerating development/minefield repos

### Discussion

-   HTCondor 23.x release candidate is deployed on the CHTC pool;
    CentOS 7 is added back as a supported platform.

-   The IGTF 1.126 CA distribution preemptively pulled the old IGTF CA (that is still valid and in use);
    OSG software will _not_ be releasing that version until the next year.


### Support Update

-   University of Tokyo/KAGRA (BrianL): University of Tokyo KAGRA cache admin's registration was not showing up in Topology;
    Brian applied a workaround and also fixed the issue with the Topology software
-   JLab (Matt): Admins were informed about a new XRootD version that should fix their crash

## DevOps

None this week

## OSG Release Team

-   Ready for Testing
    -   ospool-ep 1.0
-   Ready for Release
    -   Nothing yet
 
### Discussion

-   Delay releasing CA bundle based on IGTF 1.126 until January
-   ospool-ap should always use OSG 23 Docker images
