### Discussion

None this week

### Support Update

-   BNL (BrianL): Belle II SSL-based glideins aren't getting reported.
    Not a supported method in OSG so we have a hacky workaround where they set `orig_AuthTokenIssuer` and GRACC will map
    the value to Belle II.
-   ATLAS / BNL / AGLT2 (BrianL, MattW): questions about scheduling prioritizing cores and memory efficiency.
    Greg is taking point on the ATLAS communication thread, seems relevant for us.
    Notably UChicago doesn't have these problems: they allow Harvester to specify the memory that they want and allow
    pilots to consume 3x their memory requests
