The OSG and NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure
==========================================

The NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC\*) program invests in coordinated campus-level networking and cyberinfrastructure
improvements, innovation, integration, and engineering for science applications and distributed research projects.

In the most recent call for proposals ([NSF 20-507](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2020/nsf20507/nsf20507.htm)), joining the
[Open Science Grid](https://www.opensciencegrid.org) (OSG) is mentioned as a potential path to sharing resources with
the wider research community:

> Proposals should commit to a minimum of 20% shared time on the cluster and describe their approach to making the
> cluster available as a shared resource external to the campus. [...]
> **One possible approach to implementing such a federated distributed computing solution is joining the Open Science
> Grid.**

Contributing to the OSG
-----------------------

The OSG consortium provides common services and support for computational resource providers (i.e., "sites") using a
[distributed fabric](https://map.opensciencegrid.org) of high throughput computational (HTC) services.
These distributed-HTC (dHTC) services communicate with the site's autonomous resource management systems to provision
resources for OSG users.
The OSG itself does not own resources but provides software and services to users and resource providers alike to enable
the sharing of resources across physical and administrative boundaries.

To contribute computational resources to the OSG, the following will be needed:

- An existing compute cluster running on a [supported operating system](https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/release/supported_platforms/)
  with a supported resource management system:
  [Grid Engine](http://www.univa.com/products/),
  [HTCondor](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/),
  [LSF](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/hpc-workload-management),
  [PBS Pro](https://www.pbsworks.com/PBSProduct.aspx?n=Altair-PBS-Professional&c=Overview-and-Capabilities)/[Torque](https://adaptivecomputing.com/cherry-services/torque-resource-manager/),
  or [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/).
- Outbound network connectivity from the cluster's worker nodes
- [Temporary scratch space](https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/worker-node/using-wn/#the-worker-node-environment) on each
  worker node
- SSH access to your local cluster's submit node from a known IP address
- Shared home directories on each cluster node

    consultation, even if your site does not meet all the conditions as outlined above!
