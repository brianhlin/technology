    We need this done before we can build EL9 tarballs

### Support Update

-   Topology/GGUS (BrianL, Mat): Topology does not accept certs from SHA1-signed CAs.
    We need to petition GÃ¼nter to get the German CA to update their signing key.
-   Louvain (Mat): OSG-based CVMFS installation hitting Syracuse cache from Europe.
    We should probably just suggest that he install the EGI config while we sort out policy.

## DevOps
