OSG 24: aiming for release this Thursday!

-   VMU tests look pretty bad with testing + release as expected. Do we have a run against development?
    -   HTCondor not syncing into 24-testing/release - we might need to update el7 repo again
    -   Development tests https://osg-sw-submit.chtc.wisc.edu/tests/20241021-1629/results.html
    -   Today: Start pushing packages through -main testing and -upcoming testing
    -   We are not currently testing 24-upcoming-development, but should have been while we were building packages
-   Pelican 7.11.0 won't be ready by the initial release so we'll release with 7.10.11 and tell folks to hold off on
    installation / upgrade
-   Need to make a decision on `hosted-ce-tools` when Mat gets back
    -   Contains some cvmfsexec utilities that we might not be able to get rid of
-   AI (BrianL): write up OSG 24 initial release, review Matt's OSG 24 changes, OSDF origin/cache 
-   Container images:
    -   AI (Matt): Fix `ospool-ep` GHA + upgrade instructions
        - GHAs fixed, still need instructions
    -   Following repos need OSG 24 added: 
        -   `docker-compute-entrypoint`
        -   `docker-xcache`
        -   `gratia-probe`
        -   `htcondor-autoscale-manager`
        -   `open-science-pool-registry`
        -   `osg-repo-scripts` (?)

Kubernetes hackathon
