## OSG Software Team

Kubernetes Hackathon
-   We want to upgrade various Tiger components (Kubernetse, Flux, Kustomize) and need to make sure
    our existing apps don't get broken, making changes as necessary.
    AI (BrianA): Investigate the upgrades.  Things to note:
    -  "patchesStrategicMerge" has been replaced with "patches"
    -  "vars" are deprecated; "replacements" are the suggested replacement
-   AI (BrianL): TACC PATh Facility
-   AI (Mat): Finish deploying repo on Tempest
-   AI (Mat): osgvo-docker-pilot items

We're getting close to Done Enough for OSG 23 <https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-5503>.
Remaining top items
-   Test and provide instructions for FNAL build access. Mat to write instructions.
-   Figure out if we need VOMS for EL9/an update to EL8
-   AI (BrianL) Update docs for OSG 23 tarballs and images
-   AI (Matt): Update mash scripts to pull HTCSS 23 RC packages into 23-{main,upcoming}-testing
-   AI (Matt): cpio in EL9 tarballs
-   AI (Mat): cronjob to regen repos to pull in HTCondor RPMs

Miscellaneous
-   AI (BrianL, Mat, Matt): offboard Brian Chase

### Discussion

-   HTCondor 23.1.0 and 23.0.1 are going onto the CHTC pool this week;
    we want to deploy in the OSPool as well, but BrianL and Mat will need to help UChicago staff
    upgrade their APs to OSG 23 first.

### Support Update

-   JLab (BrianL, Matt): `fts-rest-client` created non-RFC proxies, which XRootD didn't like (reporting an unknown CA).
    Next issue is that macaroons configuration is apparently causing XRootD to dump core.
-   UCSD (Mat): feature request for OSDF area with public read and authenticated write
-   Kisti (Matt): got affirmation that new XRootD build contains the relevant changes
