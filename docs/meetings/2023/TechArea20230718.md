## OSG Software Team

Release

-   AI (Mat): Release XRootD 5.6+
-   AI (BrianL): Release xrootd-multiuser-2.1.3+
-   AI (Matt): osg-ca-scripts missing dependency on perl-filetest.
    We need this done before we can build EL9 tarballs - no longer included with base perl packages in EL9.
    MatS to provide special Perl packaging tips.
-   AI (Matt): Release oidc-agent-4.4.2+.
    SRPMs no longer provided by upstream, github is not properly organized to use as source.
    Either a spec file in the github, or return to releasing the srpm

OSG 23 tasks

-  What's the next step in the Yubikey setup for promoting packages?
   Per-developer key, packages get re-signed when promoted from development to testing
   Need to:
     - Update script OSG Promote
     - Generate promotion key
     - Create Yubikey for each developer (4 or 5)
     - Workflow update: Will need to sign packages locally, since you can't use a Yubikey on Moria
-  AI (Matt): Build buildsys-macro packages
-  AI (BrianL): build package list
-  AI (Matt): update release scripts to accommodate OSG 23
   New args: <YYMMDD> <series 1> ... <series n> (as long as it sorts)

Kubernetes Hackathon (Next Week)

-  TBD

### Discussion

None this week

### Support Update

-   Topology/GGUS (BrianL, Mat): Topology does not accept certs from SHA1-signed CAs.
    We need to petition GÃ¼nter to get the German CA to update their signing key.
    Mat: Reach out to Gunter to update CA, update Topology to temporarily accept SHA1
-   Louvain (Mat): OSG-based CVMFS installation hitting Syracuse cache from Europe.
    We should probably just suggest that he install the EGI config while we sort out policy.
-   Renewing Colorado host certificates (Matt): Awaiting approval by Douglas  

## DevOps

-   Hosted-CE availability email, will need Brian Lin to create service account (Ashton will follow up)
